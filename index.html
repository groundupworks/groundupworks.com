<p>We are a team of two Android developers building apps of excellent quality. Our apps have a refined UI and are very reliable, across Android devices, all the time. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Ground+Up+Works">Find them on Google Play.</a></p>

<a name="beta-group" class="anchor" href="#beta-group"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>beta group</h1>

<p>As a reviewer, you will be able to download "release candidate" versions of <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Ground+Up+Works">our apps from Google Play</a>, as you would normally download your Android apps. Release candidates are just one step from going public, so we expect them to be very stable software. The purpose for the beta program is to have our apps tested on more devices than we can ever own, and to collect feedback for the new features.</p>

<p>Feedback is completely voluntary and open-ended. Help us build better products by joining <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/guw-beta-reviewers">GUW Beta Reviewers</a>.</p>

<a name="open-source" class="anchor" href="#open-source"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>open source</h1>

<p>We believe in the power of open source. We have benefitted much from open source, and are committed to open sourcing sharable components in what we build. So expect this list to grow :)</p>

<a name="android-google-cloud-print-library" class="anchor" href="#android-google-cloud-print-library"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Android Google Cloud Print Library</h2>

<p>An Android library to interact with the Google Cloud Print APIs.</p>

<p>This project came about when we needed our apps to silently submit print jobs to GCP. This means without UI implications, such as the dialog that pops up when you print through the Android Print APIs. There is no way around the platform behaviour, and online searches only led to more developers stuck with the same problem when building their kiosk-style apps. So we started this project to build the print APIs that we wish existed with Google Play Services... and yes, you can print silently with this library! <a href="https://github.com/dpsm/android-print">Find it on Github.</a></p>

<h2>
<a name="android-authentication-library" class="anchor" href="#android-authentication-library"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Android Authentication Library</h2>

<p>An Android library to facilitate the selection of user accounts from the device and in obtaining Google OAuth tokens from the Google Play Services library. <a href="https://github.com/dpsm/android-auth">Find it on Github.</a></p>

<h2>
<a name="yksp" class="anchor" href="#yksp"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>yksp</h2>

<p>A fully Python-based tool that helps you automate Android UI testing and captures everything you need from each test session.</p>

<p>We built this tool to certify each release of our apps across many devices. It takes a few minutes to set up, and ships with our Flying PhotoBooth APK and sample test scripts to get you started. Let's automate our UI tests, let 'em test 'emselves, and spend our time on more important things! <a href="http://benhylau.github.io/yksp/">Find it on Github.</a></p>
